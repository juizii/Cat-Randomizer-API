# Random Cat Pic Generator
A simple test to retrieve data from a Cat API site. I really love animals and I own a cat myself, so I definitely wanted to make something that I enjoyed. Some pictures are absolute gems and others are... extremely weird. To see what I mean, please go give it a try!

# How it's made
Tech used: HTML, CSS, Javascript

I was actively searching for APIs to use on a free list and of course, my eyes locked onto the Cat API. To get more practice on fetching information from the site, I specifically chose an url that randomizes images. I used an API key to gain access to the archive and luckily for me, the only property was the image itself. Thus, I proceeded to display it onto the DOM with the handy dandy javascript, and then I could move on to my favorite part, styling ~ And for a fun addition, I made the button, that randomizes the pictures, to make a "MEOW" noise when clicked. I personally think that's the best thing of the website.
